# 📝 Quick Reference: FCM Token & MongoDB Trigger

## 🎯 What We Fixed Today:

### Issue 1: Bottom Menu ✅

- **Fixed**: Removed `initState()` workaround in `main.dart`

### Issue 2: MongoDB Trigger Error ✅

- **Fixed**: Removed `firebase-admin`, use Legacy FCM API
- **Status**: Trigger now successfully runs!

### Issue 3: FCM Token Not Found ⏳

- **Improved**: Added manual sync after MongoDB connects
- **Status**: Testing needed

---

## 🔄 How FCM Token is Saved NOW:

```dart
// 1. App starts → FCM initializes
await FCMService.initialize();  // Gets token, tries to save

// 2. MongoDB connects → Force sync token (NEW!)
await FCMService.syncTokenToMongoDB();  // Ensures token is saved

// 3. Token refreshes → Auto-saves
_firebaseMessaging.onTokenRefresh.listen((newToken) {
  _saveFCMTokenToMongoDB(newToken);  // Updates token
});
```

---

## 📊 Current Logs Show:

```
✅ "Checking budget for user: x8DjU4w7FiSvtHBQ0JAFWf5X0W42"
⚠️ "No FCM token found for user"
```

**This means:**

- ✅ Trigger is working perfectly
- ✅ Budget checking logic works
- ⚠️ FCM token not in MongoDB yet

---

## 🧪 Test Instructions:

### 1. Rebuild App:

```bash
flutter clean && flutter pub get && flutter run
```

### 2. Watch for These Logs:

```
✅ FCM service initialized
✅ MongoDB connected - cloud sync enabled
🔄 [FCM] Manually syncing token to MongoDB...
📤 [FCM] Saving token to MongoDB for user: xxx
✅ [FCM] Token saved to MongoDB for user: xxx
✅ [FCM] Token verified in MongoDB: dXj9abc...
```

### 3. Verify in MongoDB:

- Database: `pocket_organizer`
- Collection: `users`
- Query: `{ userId: "x8DjU4w7FiSvtHBQ0JAFWf5X0W42" }`
- Should have: `fcmToken` field

### 4. Test Budget Alert:

1. Set budget in Settings (e.g., Daily: $5)
2. Add expense > $4
3. Check MongoDB Trigger Logs
4. Should see: `✅ Sent daily budget alert`
5. Should receive push notification!

---

## 🔍 What to Look For:

### ✅ Success Indicators:

```
✅ [FCM] Token verified in MongoDB: dXj9abc...
✅ Sent daily budget alert to user xxx
```

### ⚠️ Warning Indicators:

```
⚠️ [FCM] No user logged in, cannot save token
⚠️ [FCM] MongoDB not connected, cannot save token
⚠️ [FCM] Token was not found in MongoDB after save!
```

### ❌ Error Indicators:

```
❌ [FCM] Failed to save token to MongoDB: [error]
❌ TypeError: Cannot access member 'GOOGLE_SDK_NODE_LOGGING'
```

## 📞 Report Back With:

1. **App startup logs** (especially FCM and MongoDB lines)
2. **MongoDB users collection** (does document exist with fcmToken?)
3. **Trigger logs** from MongoDB Atlas
4. **Did notification arrive?** Yes/No

---

## 🎯 Expected Result:

After rebuilding:

1. App starts → FCM token obtained
2. MongoDB connects → Token synced
3. Token verified in MongoDB ✅
4. Add expense → Trigger fires
5. Trigger finds token ✅
6. Push notification sent ✅
7. Device receives notification 🎉
