# iOS & Android Full Compatibility - Implementation Complete! 🎉

## ✅ All Changes Implemented

### 1. **Cross-Platform Background Tasks (iOS + Android)**

- ✅ Replaced `android_alarm_manager_plus` with `workmanager` (v0.9.0+3)
- ✅ Works on both iOS and Android
- ✅ Auto-sync (6h/8h/12h/24h) now works on iPhone
- ✅ Automated email reports now work on iPhone

### 2. **Fixed Budget Alert System**

- ✅ Alert threshold now works as **percentage** (e.g., 80%)
- ✅ Separate alert tracking for Daily, Weekly, and Monthly budgets
- ✅ Alerts send **every time you add a new expense** after crossing threshold
- ✅ No more "notification sometimes not sending" issue

---

## 📊 **How Budget Alerts Work Now:**

### **Old System (❌ Broken)**:

```
User sets: Alert Threshold = ৳100
Daily Budget = ৳350

Alert triggers when: Remaining <= ৳100
Which means: Spent >= ৳250

Problem: Confusing! Users think "100" means 100%
```

### **New System (✅ Fixed)**:

```
User sets: Alert Threshold = 80%
Daily Budget = ৳350

Alert triggers when: Spent >= 80% of ৳350
Which means: Spent >= ৳280

Clear: 80% means you've spent 80% of your budget!
```

## 🔔 **Push Notification Fix:**

### **Problem:**

- Notifications sometimes didn't send because:
  - Only 1 global alert per 24 hours
  - If daily budget alerted, weekly/monthly couldn't alert
  - User couldn't get notified on each new expense

### **Solution:**

- Separate tracking for each budget type:
  - `last_budget_alert_daily_budget_amount`
  - `last_budget_alert_weekly_budget_amount`
  - `last_budget_alert_monthly_budget_amount`
- Alerts send **every time you add a NEW expense** after crossing the threshold
- Only skips if the spent amount hasn't changed (prevents duplicate alerts)

### **Example:**

```
Daily Budget: ৳500, Threshold: 80% (alerts at ৳400+)

10:00 AM - Spent ৳350 → No alert (below 80%)
11:00 AM - Add ৳60 expense → Total ৳410 → ✅ Alert! (crossed 80%)
12:00 PM - View expenses screen → No alert (same ৳410)
2:00 PM - Add ৳30 expense → Total ৳440 → ✅ Alert! (new expense)
3:00 PM - Add ৳20 expense → Total ৳460 → ✅ Alert! (new expense)
```

**Every new expense that keeps you above the threshold triggers an alert!**

## 🎯 **Alert Threshold Examples:**

| Threshold | Daily Budget | Alert Triggers At | Remaining |
| --------- | ------------ | ----------------- | --------- |
| 50%       | ৳500         | ৳250 spent        | ৳250 left |
| 75%       | ৳500         | ৳375 spent        | ৳125 left |
| 80%       | ৳500         | ৳400 spent        | ৳100 left |
| 90%       | ৳500         | ৳450 spent        | ৳50 left  |
| 95%       | ৳500         | ৳475 spent        | ৳25 left  |
