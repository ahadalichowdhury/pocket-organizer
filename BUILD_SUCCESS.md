SENDER_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
SENDER_PASSWORD=your-app-password  # Use App Password for Gmail
SENDER_NAME=Pocket Organizer
```

**For Gmail:**

1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication
2. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
3. Generate App Password
4. Use it in `.env` file

### 2. Enable Reports in App

   - ☑️ Monthly Reports (9:00 AM every 1st)
4. Done! Cron jobs are automatically scheduled

### 3. Test It
