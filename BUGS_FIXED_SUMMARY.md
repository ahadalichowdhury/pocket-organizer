# üêõ Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed:

---

## ‚úÖ Issue #1: Bottom Menu Not Showing on First Launch

### **Problem:**
After fresh install or new login, the bottom navigation menu was not visible on first app open. Users had to close and reopen the app to see the menu.

### **Root Cause:**
The `_AppHomeState` had an unnecessary `initState()` method that was trying to force a rebuild using `addPostFrameCallback()`. This workaround was causing timing issues with the async auth state stream.

### **Solution:**
Removed the `initState()` method entirely. The bottom navigation bar now renders immediately without any workarounds since it doesn't depend on async initialization.

### **Files Changed:**
- `/lib/main.dart` (lines 117-126 removed)

### **Test:**
1. Uninstall and reinstall app
2. Login
3. Bottom menu should appear immediately ‚úÖ

## ‚úÖ Issue #2: MongoDB Atlas Trigger Error

### **Problem:**
MongoDB Atlas trigger `ExpenseSyncTrigger` was failing with error:
```
TypeError: Cannot access member 'GOOGLE_SDK_NODE_LOGGING' of undefined
```

### **Root Cause:**
The trigger function was using `firebase-admin` npm package, which depends on Google Cloud libraries that try to access Node.js environment variables (`process.env.GOOGLE_SDK_NODE_LOGGING`) that don't exist in MongoDB Atlas Functions' restricted runtime.

### **Solution:**
1. **Remove** `firebase-admin` dependency from MongoDB Atlas
2. **Use** MongoDB's built-in `context.http` API for HTTP requests
3. **Switch** to FCM Legacy API (simpler, no OAuth tokens needed)
4. **Store** FCM Server Key as MongoDB Atlas Secret

### **Files Created:**
- `/mongodb_functions/checkBudgetAndSendAlert_v2_legacy_api.js` - Updated function using Legacy FCM API
- `/MONGODB_TRIGGER_FIX.md` - Detailed fix guide
- `/QUICK_FIX_MONGODB_TRIGGER.md` - Quick 5-minute fix steps

### **Quick Fix Steps:**
1. Remove `firebase-admin` from MongoDB Atlas Dependencies
2. Update function code with new version
3. Get FCM Server Key from Firebase Console
4. Add `fcm_server_key` secret to MongoDB Atlas
5. Deploy and test

### **Why This Works:**
| ‚ùå Old | ‚úÖ New |
|--------|--------|
| Uses `firebase-admin` package | Uses `context.http` API |
| Requires Node.js environment | Works in restricted environment |
| Complex OAuth token management | Simple server key |
| Multiple dependencies | Zero dependencies |
